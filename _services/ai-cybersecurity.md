We develop an AI-driven cybersecurity applications and unified platform that detect attacker behaviors to protect your digital infrastructure, customer data, users and hosts from being compromised, regardless of location.

## Benefits of Using the Our Design Methodology

### Automates threat detections

Always-learning behavioral models use AI to efficiently find hidden and unknown attackers in real time to enable quick, decisive action and provide a clear starting point for AI-assisted threat hunting and response.

### Empowers threat hunters

Launch deeper and broader investigations of incidents detected by security controls and hunt retrospectively for undetected threats. Security insights automatically sorts and presents relevant information on detections, speeding up investigations.

### Provides visibility across entire deployment

Real time collection, analysis and storage of rich network metadata, relevant logs and cloud events provides high-fidelity visibility into the actions of all cloud and data center workloads, and user and IoT devices, leaving attackers with nowhere to hide.

### Capture once and do many things

The holistic platform collects, analyzes and enriches metadata, augmented by relevant logs and cloud events, to enable real time automated attack detection, AI-assisted threat hunting, retrospective threat hunting and incident investigation.
