Twin AI develops clinical and non-clinical AI-powered workflow solutions for radiologists and other medical imaging focussed organizations who want the most comprehensive technology, without the complexity. The AI medical imaging platforms we create automatically standardizes data, and provides a host of AI-powered solutions for reading, reporting, QA and research.

Build with deep learning technology and trained using millions of images, our AI medical imaging solutions identify and localize abnormalities on X-rays, MRI and CT scans.

## Deep learning in disease detection and prediction

A higher-level application of deep learning in the medical imaging workflow is centered around diagnosis and prediction through image segmentation or pattern detection. Segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple regions that have certain relevant attributes in common. In line with the common narrative of deep-learning assisted solutions, recent research supports the claim that segmentation is performed more efficiently by computers than it is by humans. Automatizing this task improves disease detection workflows.
