&nbsp; In my previous post, we took a look at a Node.js Template engine **Pug**. Today, I'm going to post about processing data requested by GET, POST Methods.
&nbsp; &nbsp; - [[Node.js] Simple guide for the template engine PUG](https://jerry901.github.io/2020/03/2020-03-06-01/)  

# Performing GET Request

## Create form_get.pug 
&nbsp; First of all, we are going to create a template which consists of Input box, Text area, and Submit button. This page will send '/get_receicer' request when the submit button is pressed. Create a file named ```form_get.pug```. 
```
doctype html
html
    head
        meta(charset='utf-8')
    body
        form(action='/get_receiver' method='GET')
            p
                input(type='text' name='title')
            p
                textarea(name='description')
            p
                input(type='submit')
```

## Create get.js 
&nbsp; The data which has been given to server by GET Method is in 'query' which is a property of Request object. To process the data, create your ```get.js``` file like below.

```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.locals.pretty = true;
app.set('views', './views');
app.set('view engine', 'pug');

app.get('/form_get', function(req, res){ 
        res.render('form_get'); 
});

app.get('/get_receiver', function(req, res){ 
        var title = req.query.title; 
        var description= req.query.description;
        res.send(title+', '+description);
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});
```

# Check the result 
&nbsp; Run server by executing ```get.js``` command .  
```bash
 $ node get.js
```

Go to the ```form page``` by requesting ```http://base_url/form_get``` on your browser, Fill the form, and then press the submit button.

We can see the data we sent just sent has been processed sucessfully, and come back!


# Performing POST Request

## Create form_get.pug 
&nbsp; Create ```form_post.pug``` like below . It is mostly the same as ```form_get.pug``` file, but the action of form tag has been chaged to ```Post Method```.
```
doctype html
html
    head
        meta(charset='utf-8')
    body
        form(action='/post_receiver' method='POST')
            p
                input(type='text' name='title')
            p
                textarea(name='description')
            p
                input(type='submit')
```
## Install body-parser
&nbsp; To process the data from Post Method, we need to you the property  ```body``` in the request object. However, Body property is set to the undefined by default, So we need to get a module that let us able to use the property called ```body-parser```. Lets install the moudlue with a command below.
```bash
 $ npm install body-parser
```
## Create post.js
&nbsp; Add a code that allow ```app object``` to be able to use ```body-parser module```, and we are going to use app.post() Method instead of app.get() method.
```js
var express = require('express');
var bodyParser= require('body-parser');
var app = express();

app.locals.pretty = true;
app.set('views', './views');
app.set('view engine', 'pug');
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));

app.get('/form_post', function(req, res){
        res.render('form_post');
});

app.post('/post_receiver', function(req, res){
        var title = req.body.title;
        var description= req.body.description;
        res.send(title+', '+description);
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});
```

# Check the result 
&nbsp; 먼저 ```post.js```를 실행합니다.  
```bash
 $ node post.js
```  
![ex_screenshot](/assets/images/2020-03-04/2020-03-06-02-post-req.png)  
Go to the ```form page``` by requesting ```http://base_url/form_post``` on your browser, Fill the form, and then press the submit button.
