&nbsp; Today, we are gonna take a quick look at Installing and a simple usage of the Node.js template engine called ***Pug***

# Template Engine ?
&nbsp; Template engine is used to generate HTML pages with vairables in them. For example, in case of user information page, every user wll see the same template but gets different information depending on the user who has requested the page. In this case, it's better to have one specific HTML template and fiil the data which is selected with user ID.

# Install PUG
&nbsp; Move to the root directory of the npm project, and update the core-js.
```bash
 $ npm update core-js 
```
Install Pug, and create a directory named ***views***. If you use ***--save*** option, you will get Pub in your package.json file as one of the dependencies.

```bash
 $ npm install pug --save
 $ mkdir views
```

# Create temp.pug
&nbsp; Move to ***Views*** and create ```temp.pug```. In ```.pug``` files, The html hierarchy is expressed with ***indent*** of each line, and the template engine translate code like below to HTML tags. Also, we can do some logic in ```.pug``` files, but we need to make sure that we mean to use logic by adding ``Dash( - )``` at the beginning of the line since it uses '=' operator to print data which is given by Controller.
```
html
    head
        title= _title
    body
        h1 hello Pug!
        ul
            - for(var i=0; i<5; i++)
                li coding
        div= time
```

# Wirte code in app.js file
&nbsp; Write app.js file or create it like below. ```res.render()``` method accepts the parameter formatted in ```Key : Value``` which is its second parameter, and theses can be used as variables in temp.pug file. This is the biggest reason why we use template engine.

```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.locals.pretty = true; // beatify the html code made with template engine

app.set('views', './views'); // set the directory where your template files exist
app.set('view engine', 'pug'); // set which template engine to use

app.get('/template', function(req, res){ // routing the request
     res.render('temp', {time: Date(), _title: 'PUG'});
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});
```

# Check the result 
&nbsp;After running the server with command ```$ node app.js```, go to http://localhost:3000/template (local server) or http://AWS_PUBLIC_DNS:3000/template:3000 (AWS) to check the result.
