&nbsp; ***AWS*** has been the most popular web service for years, and most of the companies that you might want to give your resume to would probably require your abilities of some AWS services. Therefore, there is no wonder that you must know how to use AWS or how it works if you want to get a job as a Web developer. Today, I'm going to post about how to make a basic node.js application on AWS.

# Create a Project

&nbsp; First of all, make a directory to save your source file, and go to the directory.

```bash
 $ mkdir node; cd ./node
```
For the next, Initialize current directory as a ***npm project***. There will be some break point asking you to write some informations of this project but those are not important at all. Just keep hitting ***Enter***.

```bash
 $ npm init
```
Install ***express.js***
```bash
 $ npm install --save express
```

# Write example.js file
```bash
 vi example.js
```

This code below is a sample code which is on the ***official Web site*** of Express.js

```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});


app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});
```

# Add a Inbound Rule to the EC2 Security Group
&nbsp; On the AWS Web, move to ```AWS Home > EC2 > NETWORK & SECURITY > Security Groups```, click "Edit" button in "Inboud" tab, and add a ***Custom TCP Rule*** (port: 3000).

# Run example.js 
&nbsp; Lets go back to the AWS Terminal, and run example.js

```bash
 $ node example.js
```

# Check the result
&nbsp; When you request http://AWS_public_DNS:3000 on your browser, you would be able to see the Hello world! as a result. ***Public DNS***is an address that you can see on the list of your AWS instances which is exactly like ***ec1-23-456-789-000.ap-northeast-0.compute.amazonaws.com***.
