&nbsp; In my previous post, I dealed with **[Jekyll Install on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://jerry901.github.io/en/2020/01/2020-01-26-02/)**.
Today, let's take a look at how to publish Gihub pages with **Jekyll**

## Create a new Github Repository 

&nbsp; First of all, You need to **[create a new Github repository](http://www.github.com/new)** in order to upload static pages created by Jekyll. **Repository name** field should be formatted as **username.github.io**. Tnen, this name will work as a domain of your site.

## Download a theme 
&nbsp; Secondly, **[Pick a theme here](http://jekyllthemes.org)** that you might want to apply on your bolg. 
What i picked was **[Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)** theme which is one of the most popular Jekyll themes and also this blog was made with.  
  
&nbsp;Run the commands below to install Minimal Mistakes. 
If you chose another theme for your site, change the URL parameter of ``` $ git clone```command to the URL of the theme you picked.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git
```
## Build the project
```bash
$ cd minimal-mistakes
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
&nbsp; If you see the result below, the build has done succesfully.
```bash
Configuration file: /home/userName/minimal-mistakes/_config.yml
            Source: /home/userName/minimal-mistakes
       Destination: /home/userName/minimal-mistakes/_site

 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/home/userName/minimal-mistakes'
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
    Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```
&nbsp; Check if your local server works well by connecting to 
**[http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)** or **[http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)**.  

## Commit sources to the repository 
&nbsp; Clone your **```userName.github.io```** repository, and copy the files in minimal-mistakes directory to the local repositroy. 
Then, your pages will be published on github.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone repository_URL 
$ cp -r minimal-mistakes/* local_repo_folder_name
$ cd local_repo_folder_name
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "hello my blog"
$ git push origin master 
```
Go to ```https://userName.github.io``` and see if your blog has been published successfully. It might take a few munites to be able to see the changes.
