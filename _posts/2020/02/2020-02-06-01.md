&nbsp;On this post, I will provide you guys with some guided steps on **how to make your Github pages multilingual** using one of Jekyll plugins. 
To apply the multilingual feature, It is better to use **plugin**, but Github does not support any other plugins with itself other than a few basic plugins for security reasons. 
Therefore, uploading a project with some plugins will cause an **Error** during the project build process. However, it's not that there is no way out at all.
It might help us skip the build process of Github to push pages that have been generated on your local environment to the master branch**. Also, we can still control the versions of your Jekyll project by creating a new branch for you projects to be pushed. 
We can barely find information on applying multilingual feature to the github blog, so I hope this post will help many people have their Github pages more global.

## jekyll-multiple-laguages plug-in installation
&nbsp;There are several ways to install jekyll-multiple-laguages-plugin. What i have chosen from those ways is to use **git submodule* because depending on the theme that I use, there may be issues related to the dependencies of gems.
What you have to do first is to go to **root directory** of your Jekyll project and execute the following command:
```bash
 $ git submodule add git://github.com/screeninteraction/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin.git _plugins/multiple-languages
 $ ls _plugins/
``` 
If you can see this result from running **ls _plugins/** command, 
it should have been installed successfully.
```bash
multiple-languages
```

## Setting _config.yml file
&nbsp;Add the information of languages you want to support to the **_config.yml** file. 
The first element of it will be used as the **default language**
```yml
# languages
# default langages : "ko" 
languages: ["ko", "en"]
```
## Directory structure
In the Jekyll project without multiple-languages-plugin,  Jekyll builds the **.md files** under _post folder in the root directory of your project. However, if you install jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin, 
**jekyll serve command will build the _posts folder under the _i18n directory**. 
Therefore, the following directory structure is required:
```bash
project_root/
-- _i18n/
---- en/
------ _post/
-------- yyyy-mm-dd-01.md # your posts / .md
-------- yyyy-mm-dd-02.md
-------- yyyy-mm-dd-03.md
         ...
---- ko/
------ _post/
-------- yyyy-mm-dd-01.md # your posts / .md
-------- yyyy-mm-dd-02.md
-------- yyyy-mm-dd-03.md
         ...
---- en.yml
---- ko.yml
```

## Setting lanugages.yml files
### en.yml (example)
```yml
global:
  english: Eng 
  korean: Kor
pages:
  home: Home
  work: Work
titles:
  pagination: Pagination
```
### ko.yml (example)
```yml
global:
  english: Eng 
  korean: Kor
pages:
  home: Home
  work: Work
titles:
  pagination: Pagination
```

## Visiting multiligual pages 
### Default language page (Korean)
```bash
 https://blogurl.io/yyyy-mm-dd-01
 https://localhost:4000/yyyy-mm-dd-01
```

### Multiligual pages (English) 
```bash
 https://blogurl.io/en/yyyy-mm-dd-01
 https://localhost:4000/en/yyyy-mm-dd-01
```

## Publishing automatically
### Create a source branch and set it to the default branch
&nbsp; **Run** these commands below in you **local repository**; 
git push **-u** option does nothing, but later on you can just simply push your sources **without typing the name of branches**.
```bash
 $ git checkout -b source master
 $ git push -u origin source
```
And then, go to ```Github web > your repository > Settings > Branches > Default branch```, **set the source branch to the default branch**.

### Rakefile 
Run ```vi Rakefile``` or ```vi rakefile``` on the root directory of your jekyll project. and add the flowing. If there is no rakefile, you can just **create a new one**.
```bash
# Auto publish
# Change your GitHub reponame
GITHUB_REPONAME = "username/username.github.io"

desc "Generate blog files"
task :generate do
  Jekyll::Site.new(Jekyll.configuration({
    "source"      => ".",
    "destination" => "_site"
  })).process
end

desc "Generate and publish blog to gh-pages"
task :publish => [:generate] do
  Dir.mktmpdir do |tmp|
    cp_r "_site/.", tmp

    pwd = Dir.pwd
    Dir.chdir tmp

    system "git init"
    system "git add ."
	message = "Site updated at #{Time.now.utc}"
	system "git commit -m #{message.inspect}"
    system "git remote add origin https://github.com/#{GITHUB_REPONAME}.git"
    system "git push origin master --force"

    Dir.chdir pwd
  end
end
```
### Run rake publish
&nbsp; Now you can easily publish your pages that have been generated in you local environment to the master branch by running```rake publish``` or ```bundle exec rake publish```, and push your project to the source branch by running ```git push``` command 

###  Language switcher
&nbsp; Now that you got a multilingual feature, you might need a langage switcher. Here's an example source of the language switcher that you can see on the top of this blog. I added it below the <nav> tag of masthead.html. (CSS might need to be configured)
{% highlight html%}
{% raw %}
<nav id="lang-sel" >
    <ul class="lang">
        {% capture link1 %}{{ site.baseurl_root }}{{ page.url}}{% endcapture %}
        {% capture link2 %}{{ site.baseurl_root }}/en{{ page.url}}{% endcapture %}
        {% if site.lang == "ko" %}
        <li class="masthead_menu-item visible-links">
	        <a href="{{ link1 }}" class="enabled">{% t global.korean%} </a>|<a href="{{ link2 }}"> {% t global.english%}</a>
        </li>
        {% elsif site.lang == "en" %}
        <li class="masthead_menu-item lang">
	        <a href="{{ link1 }}">{% t global.korean%} </a>|<a href="{{ link2 }}" class="enabled"> {% t global.english%}</a>
        </li>
        {% endif %}
    </ul>
 </nav>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight%}

## Finishing this post..
&nbsp; i have spent a lot of time to make this feature work out. I hope somebody can get some help with this, and save their time.
