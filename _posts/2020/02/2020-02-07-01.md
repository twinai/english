&nbsp;Today, I'm going to post about the way **how to make .sh files executable** on Linux command line.

## Create HelloWorld.sh 
&nbsp; First, **Create HelloWorld.sh file** like below.
```bash
 $ echo "Hello World!"
```

## Run chmod +x HelloWorld.sh 

&nbsp; **Run chmod +x command**, then now you can execute HelloWorld.sh by running ```./HelloWorld.sh``` command
```bash
 $ chmod +x HelloWorld.sh
 $ ./HelloWorld.sh
```
```bash
 Hellow World!
```
## How to globally execute .sh files 
&nbsp; To globally execute your .sh files, 
you need to move them to ```~/.local/bin/```.
This folder is given to the user with nothing(~~maybe~~) inside once the OS is installed, and is **basically added to the $PATH variable**. 

```bash
 $ mv ./HellowWorld.sh ~/.local/bin; cd ~/.local/bin/
```

Actually, The extension ```.sh``` is just to let users know that it is .sh file, and do nothing special. So, let's do a trick like this.
**&nbsp;#Althogh you move your shell script file to ~/.local/bin/,** **you still have to run** ```chmod +x filname``` **command at the fist time**.
```bash
 $ mv ./HelloWorld.sh HelloWorld
```
## Run HelloWorld file
&nbsp;Now you can globally execute the shell script file anywhere as if it one of the commands that you have by typing ``` HelloWorld``` on your command line. 
```bash
 $ cd
 $ HelloWorld
 ```
 ```bash
 Hello World!
 ```
 ```bash
 $ cd Documents
 $ HelloWorld
 ```
 ```bash
 Hello World!
```
