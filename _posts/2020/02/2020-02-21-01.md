# Solution
The basic idea is this : Any of arr[i] means the index where it actually have to go to because all of the cases are consecutive, 
from '1' to 'n'. There are no cases like "{1, 2, 4, 8, 9}" as a simple example. 
What i did was to keep swapping the elements arr[i] and arr[arr[i]-1] till the element of arr[i] becomes i+1 for every loop; 
arr[0] should become '1', arr[1] should become '2', arr[3] = '3' and so on. 
This worked very well and i think it's simple. i'm sharing my code just in case for someone it could be a little help. Happy practicing.

# Example case
{5, 3, 1, 2, 6, 4} swap(0, 4) cuz number 5 must be at the index **4** which is **5th index** of its array  

{6, 3, 1, 2, **5**, 4} swap(0, 5)  

{4, 3, 1, 2, **5**, **6**} swap(0, 3)  

{2, 3, 1, **4**, **5**, **6**} swap(0, 1)  

{3, **2**, 1, **4**, **5**, **6**} swap(0, 2)  

{**1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, **5**, **6**}

In this case, we can get the array fully sorted only at index '0'  

# Source
```cpp
// Written in c++
int num_of_swap;
vector<int> arr; // Changed arr to global variable

int swap(int curIndex){
    if(arr[curIndex] == curIndex+1)
        return 0;

    int temp = arr[curIndex];
    arr[curIndex] = arr[temp-1];
    arr[temp-1] = temp;
		
    num_of_swap++;

    return 1;
}

// Complete the minimumSwaps function below.
int minimumSwaps(vector<int> arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++){
        while(swap(i));
    }
		
    return num_of_swap;
}
```
